This command depends on emacsc(1) and ediff-batch.el.  Put the
following lines in your Emacs initialization file.

    (require 'emacsc)
    (require 'ediff-batch)

        exit 64;
    }

    eval {

            sprintf(q{(ediff-files-in-batch-mode "%s" "%s")},
                    map { elisp_escape($_) } @files);
    };
    if ($@) {
        print STDERR $name, ": ", $@;
        exit 1;
    }
}
