;;; Commentary:

;; emacsc(1) is a wrapper of emacsclient(1) for use within a terminal,
;; and emacsc.el is a tiny little tweak to the server module to help
;; emacsc(1) interact with the running Emacs.

;; This package contains some scripts in the `bin' directory, so
;; install them manually into a directory in your path.  For example,
;; dired(1) opens a directory with dired, magit(1) opens a directory
;; with magit-status, ediff(1) is a diff(1) like tool to invoke
;; ediff-files, and so on.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(eval-after-load "server"
  '(defadvice server-eval-and-print
     (before emacsc-suppress-output (expr proc) activate)
     (when (string-prefix-p "@" expr)
       (ad-set-arg 0 (substring expr 1))
       (ad-set-arg 1 nil))))

(provide 'emacsc)

;;; emacsc.el ends here
